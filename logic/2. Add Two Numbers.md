You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
**Output:** [7,0,8]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
**Output:** [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]


## Solution: 

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
       self.val = val
       self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy  = ListNode()
        current = dummy
        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            sum = v1+v2+carry
            carry  = sum//10
            digit = sum%10

            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next

            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

            current.next = ListNode(digit)
            current = current.next
        
        return dummy.next
```


## Theory:

Linked List is a type of data structure in which the i<sup>th</sup> element is linked to the next element.
The final element is linked to null.  
It is used in replacement for normal arrays as it is dynamic.
It generally contains two things: its value and a pointer to the next value.

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
       self.val = val
       self.next = next
```

## Logic: 

First we define a fake linked list node `dummy` and then we create a `current` variable and set it to `dummy`. 

We do this to initialise a linked list so that we can later link newer elements to it.
Next we create an while loop so that the loop stops when there are no more elements left in `l1` ,`l2` and  there is no carry.

Next we create a logic for adding as follows:
```
[2,4,3]
[5,6,4]+
-------
[7,0,8]
```
Here we start adding from the right side(addition of reverse numbers) and the carry is added to the number on the right.

It is important to set digit as the one's digit of the sum and carry as the ten's digit.

Each individual results is linked to the linked list `current` as  `current.next = ListNode(digit)` and then we move the cursor to the next element in the linked list as `current = current.next`.

After the while loop exits, we `return dummy.next` as the linked list looks as follows:

	0 -> 7 -> 0 -> 8 -> null

This 0 is not part of the solution and thus we return the next element.
