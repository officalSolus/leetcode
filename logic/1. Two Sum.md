[[Hash Map]]

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]

## Solution:
```
class Solution:
     def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}

        for i,num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in seen:
                return [seen[diff],i]
            seen[num] = i
```            


## Logic: 

We create a dict which contains pairs of {number: index}.
Then we calculate the difference in target value and current value of num.

Now, if the difference value is already present as a key in the dictionary, then we return the [value of that key, the current index of num]

If the difference value is not present in the dictionary, we create a key value pair in seen {num : i}.

The above method has a time complexity of O(n).
