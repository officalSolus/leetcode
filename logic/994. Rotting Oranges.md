[[Queue]]
You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.


```
from collections import deque

    def orangesRotting(self,grid):
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        queue = deque()
        fresh = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    queue.append((r, c))
                elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh += 1

            return 0

        directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        
        while queue:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                r, c = queue.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 2
                        fresh -= 1
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
